# A-whimsical-evening

Hi kiddoes! This to practice collaborative development using version control. We will create a base file, that has the beginning of a story, then we'll each create our own branches (versions) and take it in different directions, then bring them back together. Tessa, you and your Csopa group might find this useful when developing plays!
