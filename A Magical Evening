This is the start of the story 

The peacocks lined up at the base of the tree, and one by one jumped up onto the first branch, shuffled along to make room for their siblings, and then sprung out into the air, flapping up into the tree tops. They each had their own special branch, which only they were allowed to sleep on. Unless, that is, little Percival had a beak ache, in which case Patricia would sometimes let them up onto their own branch for a snuggle.
