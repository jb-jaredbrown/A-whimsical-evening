This is the start of the story 
This was going to be an awesome evening, in fact it was going to be the best one EVER. The plan was for Beanie, Korbear, and Daddy to go mini golfing at Blenkinsop putts, then buy sushi from Fugiya and then fly home to sleep in the tent in the backyard with the Jackalops to snuggle with and Peacocks to sing us to sleep. So Beanie, Korbear and Daddy opened their wings and obviously Korbear was the first to dibs DJ. So we listened to "Don't call me a noob", "Spider man sings a song", "Better when I'm dancing" and "Back in Black". It took a little longer then we thought because one of the air giant oons was practicing their magic and accidentally let a tornado loose. The ADSC [Air Department Of Sky Control] took care of the problem but cut off the air lane, so we had to take a de-tour through the fire mountains. Thankfully Blenkinsop Putts is in the Pink Forest, which also means that at this time of year it is spring there so it would be nice and cool.
